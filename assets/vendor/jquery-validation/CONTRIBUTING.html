<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT EMAIL VALIDATION</strong>. As of version 1.12.0 this plugin is using the same regular expression that the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#valid-e-mail-address">HTML5 specification suggests for browsers to use</a>.
    We will follow their lead and use the same check. If you think the specification is wrong, please report the issue to them. If you have different requirements,
    consider <a href="http://jqueryvalidation.org/jQuery.validator.addMethod/">using a custom method</a>.</p>
